Hi I am Ankit Kundu.
And I like to code.
I am currently pursuing B.tech in Computer Science Engineering from KIIT, Bhubaneshwar, India.
Programming languages that i have managed to master are being Python and C/C++.
I am interested in Data Structure and algorithm and i have learned DBMS using Mysql.
Looking forward to my future goals are to master the front-end programming languages being HTML,CSS & JS.
Hope I didn't bore you talking about myself...
